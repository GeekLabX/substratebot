Their main functions are to alert about events that take place in the networks and to collect statistic about networks status. However the variety of possible single notifications and combination of notifications is huge, that makes these bots very useful and powerful tools.
Bots can be used in two ways:
as a personal informational bot, sending alerts in a private chat;
as informational bot for Telegram groups showing statistic of network, current price (optional) and sending democracy alerts (optional).

## Personal informational bot.

All notifications are divided into 3 groups: `Address alerts`, `Democracy and Treasury` alerts and alerts of `Advanced mode`.

`Rewards` - bot sends message about rewards received to tracked account;
`Slash` - bot sends message if tracked account is slashed;

By default some points of menu are selected, but you can select/deselect only those points you need. After selecting, choose `Enter address`.

Put in the Polkadot/Kusama public address in the field below. As an answer you will get requirement to enter a name for this address (in case tracked address has no Identity on chain, if it has, bot uses Identity).

After sending the name to bot, you will get second confirmation on alert set.

## Advanced mode.

If pre-configured notifications are not enough, please choose `Advanced mode`. Please be noted that you should understand what [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) is to get maximum value from this mode.
All [Events](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/events) and [Extrinsics](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/learn-substrate/extrinsics) are collected here. In short, Extrinsics - are methods that either users or smart contracts call in the network, Events - are the events that these methods trigger.

Also they are grouped into modules from Polkadot and Kusama.

![advanced1](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*y1Mf0ZApjAmlCH8A)

After selecting a module you are required to select a type of alert: Extrinsics or Events (if available)

![module](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*3AaWcPG899tukX2O)

Next step is to set up `Filters`. Please be noted that correct use of `Filters` is very important stage and helps you to avoid unnecessary information.

\*For example: in case Filter `Target` is not selected for Event `Transfer` bot will send information about ALL transfers in the network.

![event transfer](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*slNq3pV6KjPU5wKp)

If there no need in filters choose `Create Alert` button and get confirmation.

## Examples of notification in advanced mode.

1.In case you want to be notified when transfer on more than 100000 \$KSM takes place, following path should be done:

`Advanced > Balances > Events > Transfer > Filters > Value > (>100000) > Exit filtering mode > Create alert`

![transfer10k](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9d9Usv60fjHmWLG1qtkAmA.png)

2. If you want to track when some account votes.

`Advanced > Democracy > Extrinsics > Vote > FILTERS > sender > Enter address > Exit 'Filtering mode' > Create Alert`

![dem sender](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*QlnkfkMTbyzzXBoS.png)

## Alerts managements. My addresses/alerts.

All your alerts are grouped by the accounts they're linked to. If an alert is not linked to any of your accounts, it is added to 'Other Alerts' group.

![my alerts](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*H9lq41YjE77nP0SReXMP7w.png)

You can easily manage added addresses, delete and rename .
